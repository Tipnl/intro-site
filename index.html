          <h3>Working with Computers</h3>
          <p>
            I have been using computers ever since i was a small child. I
            remember having my first computer that didn't even include an O.S!
            After that i got my very own PC at the age of 11. I spent all day
            playing games and browsing the internet. I knew right then and there
            that i would want to work with computers, and thus started studying
            IT. In the end it wasn't like i imagined it would be and found a
            love for coding instead.

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>
            Alot of people enjoy playing a game once in a while. Wether that be
            on PC or on a console. I have been gaming since i was a child and
            noticed that i am better than the average gamer. For this reason i
            have at one point tried to become a professional gamer. However, Due
            to me getting older my reactions and responses aren't as they used
            to be and thus i had to call that quits! I enjoy the occasional game
            of League of Legends, Apex Legends and a mobile game called Raid:
            Shadow Legends.
